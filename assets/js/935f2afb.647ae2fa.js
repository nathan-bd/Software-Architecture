The SDLC consists of a series of structured phases that guide teams from initial planning through to the deployment and maintenance of software. This lifecycle ensures software is developed systematically, efficiently, and measurably. By exploring each phase of the SDLC, we aim to equip you with a comprehensive understanding of how to manage software projects successfully, minimise risks, and enhance overall productivity. Whether you are an experienced developer or new to the field, grasping the intricacies of the SDLC will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of software architecture and development.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Software Architecture/stakeholder-managmenet":{"id":"Software Architecture/stakeholder-managmenet","title":"Stakeholder Management and Requirements Engineering","description":"Stakeholder Management and Requirements Engineering are critical components of the software development process, essential for ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs and business goals.
